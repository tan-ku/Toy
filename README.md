Practice using Github Markdown

Work on one markdown file together; explain one markdown command, e.g. create a list.

 When done, do a pull request.
 
 Next, review each other's pull requests.
 
 Merge each pull request to the master branch
 
 After each merge, update the next pull request that you want to merge.
